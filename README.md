# neuroevolution
My ongoing attempt at a simulated evolving ecosystem.

It consists of these [little guys](https://imgur.com/Db41amn).
They have little feedforward neural network brains that will be
subjected to evolutionary pressures. They start off random, tadpoles
flailing around randomly. But hopefully, once I get it all working, the
tadpoles with the best brains will be able to propagate themselves until
I've bred a population of relatively intelligent web browser buddies that
can traverse their environment effectively.
