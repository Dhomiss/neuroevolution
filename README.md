# neuroevolution
My ongoing attempt at a simulated evolving ecosystem.

It consists of these little guys:

They have little feed-forward neural network brains that will be
subjected to evolutionary pressures. They start off with randomized brains, 
flailing around randomly. But hopefully, once I get it all working, the
tadpoles with the best brains will be able to propagate themselves until
I've bred a population of relatively intelligent web browser buddies that
can eat, attack, and breed through their environment effectively.
