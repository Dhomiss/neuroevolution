# neuroevolution

My ongoing attempt at a simulated evolving ecosystem.

It consists of these little guys:

They have little feed-forward neural network brains that will be
subjected to evolutionary pressures. They start off with randomized brains,
flailing around dumbly. But hopefully, once I get it all working, the
tadpoles with the best brains will be able to propagate themselves until
I've bred a population of relatively intelligent web browser buddies that
can eat, attack, and breed through their environment effectively.

If for some reason you do download this, you can press 'L' to spawn your own
controllable tadpole (WASD keys) and click to spawn food. As of now,
the nutrition and energy expenditure is pretty unbalanced, so the tadpoles
starve quite quickly... poor little things.
